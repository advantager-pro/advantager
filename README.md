### EVM
Advantager helps the decision making processes by providing tools and performance measuring metrics such as [EVM](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earned_value_management). EVM enables you to integrate the project scope, time, and costs, while generating progress and status metrics and forecasts of progress towards a completion date.

Advantager was designed in such a way to provide all the EVM features without requiring any new input or workflow from the user. So from an user based perspective the tool usage is just like most project managers. In summary Advantager brings EVM indicators, forecasts, and decision making features without requiring any extra effort.

### Earned Schedule
EVM indicators allows you to determine if the project is over or under the budget, the costs performance and also estimates the remaining and final project budget. In the other hand the [Earned Schedule](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earned_schedule) is an EVM extension with better time-related indicators and forecasts. Earned Schedule main advantages are:
* It provides the project estimated duration.
* Forecasts regarding the project duration.
* Project time/schedule performance metrics.
* Early warnings regarding possible problematic tasks.
* Etc.

### Audit in data analysis
While performing analysis of the project performance the user is also able to review exactly what changes other users made to cause any specific situation.
